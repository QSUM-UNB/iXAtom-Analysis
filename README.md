# iXAtom-Analysis
Analysis code for data generated by the iXAtom experiment. 

- Code written in Python (3.10 compatible)
- Under development by B. Barrett since November 2019
- Version 3.2.4 initially committed to master branch
- Version 3.2.5 (this version):
  - Moved contents to 'iXAtom_Main.py' to 'iXAtom_Main_Analysis.py'
  - Added 'iXAtom_Main_Systematics.py' as main entry point for Systematics class
