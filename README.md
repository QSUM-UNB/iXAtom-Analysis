# iXAtom-Analysis
Analysis code for data generated by the iXAtom experiment. 

- Code written in Python (3.10 compatible)
- Under development by B. Barrett since November 2019
- Version 3.2.4 initially committed to master branch
- Version 3.2.5 (this version):
  - Moved contents to 'iXAtom_Main.py' to 'iXAtom_Main_Analysis.py'
  - Added 'iXAtom_Main_Systematics.py' as main entry point for Systematics class

Code structure:

- iXAtom_Main_Analysis:
- 	Main implementation of iXAtom analysis package.
- 	Compatible with iXAtom LabVIEW Data Acquisition v3.2 and later.
- iXAtom_Main_Systematics: Main implementation for evaluation of iXAtom systematic effects.

- Class RunParameters (calls class Physics): for parsing and storing run parameters from file
	- Subclass: Detection (calls Utilities) 
	- Subclass: Monitor (calls Utilities)
	- Subclass: Raman (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Ramsey (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Rabi (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Track (calls Physics, Utilities)
- Class Stream (calls Utilities)
- Class Physics (requires instance of RunParameters)
	- Subclass: Systematics (requires instance of RunParameters)
- Utilities (stores custom plotting methods, reading/writing methods, and analysis methods
	for use in all classes)
