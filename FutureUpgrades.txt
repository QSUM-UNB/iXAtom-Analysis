Future upgrades to iXAtom analysis

(1) Copy auxiliary run parameters to a file in each 'Post-Processed/Run' folder to easily recall later
(2) Related to (1): separate software dependencies on raw and post-processed data so that one requires only the post-processed data folder to run analysis levels 2 and above.
(3) Related to (1): Merge raw and post-processed data frames (as in ICE analysis)
(4) Write individual entry point files for Raman, Ramsey, etc. to help store settings from one day to another
(X) Create a Rabi class and write associated analysis
(6) Merge sequence timing extraction from Tracking and RunParameters classes
(7) Add functionality to overlap Allan deviations from different Tracking runs (i.e. store Tracking summaries)
(8) Add functionality to overlap data from a series of Raman and Tracking runs
(9) Add override for iaxList to analyze only one axis if requested
(10) Upgrade monitor correlation for LabVIEW Software v3.3

Present code structure:

- Class RunParameters (calls Physics)
	- Subclass: Detection (calls Utilities)
	- Subclass: Monitor (calls Utilities)
	- Subclass: Raman (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Ramsey (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Rabi (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Track (calls Physics, Utilities)
- Class Stream (calls Utilities)
- Class Physics (requires instance of RunParameters)
	- Subclass: Systematics (requires instance of RunParameters)
- Utilities (stores custom plotting methods, reading/writing methods, and analysis methods
	for use in all classes)

Improved code structure:

- Class Data (stores general attributes and methods for all possible data types,
	e.g. file paths, sequence timing, reading/writing methods, etc.)
	- Subclass: RunParameters (stores run parameter attributes)
	- Subclass: Detection (stores raw detection data and methods)
	- Subclass: Monitor (stores monitor data and methods)
	- Subclass: Raman
	- Subclass: Ramsey
	- Subclass: Rabi
	- Subclass: Track
	- Subclass: Stream
- Class Physics (stores physical constants and functions, requires instance of RunParameters)
	- Subclass: Systematics (requires instance of RunParameters)
- Class Analysis (stores custom analysis methods for use in all classes,
	e.g. fit models, moving averages, PSDs, allan deviations, time series analysis, etc.)
- Class Plotting (stores custom plotting methods for use in all classes)
