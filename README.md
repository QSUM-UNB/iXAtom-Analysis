# iXAtom-Analysis
Analysis code for data generated by the iXAtom experiment. 

- Code written in Python (3.10 compatible)
- Under development by B. Barrett since November 2019
- Version 3.2.4 initially committed to master branch
- Version 3.2.5 (this version):
  - Moved contents to 'iXAtom_Main.py' to 'iXAtom_Main_Analysis.py'
  - Added 'iXAtom_Main_Systematics.py' as main entry point for Systematics class

## Code structure

- iXAtom_Main_Analysis:
	- Main implementation of iXAtom analysis package.
	- Compatible with iXAtom LabVIEW Data Acquisition v3.2 and later.
- iXAtom_Main_Systematics:
	- Main implementation for evaluation of iXAtom systematic effects.
- Class RunParameters (calls class Physics):
	- For parsing and storing run parameters from file
- Class Detection (calls Utilities):
	- Class for processing and storing data from detection traces
  	- Inherits all attributes and methods from class RunParameters
- Class Monitor (calls Utilities):
	- Class for storing, merging, and manipulating monitor data
	- Inherits all attributes and methods from class RunParameters




	- Subclass: Raman (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Ramsey (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Rabi (calls Detection, Physics, Utilities)
	- Subclass: Track (calls Physics, Utilities)
- Class Stream (calls Utilities)
- Class Physics (requires instance of RunParameters)
	- Subclass: Systematics (requires instance of RunParameters)
- Utilities (stores custom plotting methods, reading/writing methods, and analysis methods
	for use in all classes)
